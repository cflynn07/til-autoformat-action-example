# TIL
> Today I Learned

### Example Repo  
  
This is an example repository that uses my GitHub Action
[cflynn07/github-action-til-autoformat-readme][3]. This GitHub Action
automatically generated this README.md based on the TILs in this repository.
---
A collection of concrete writeups of small things I learn daily while working
and researching. My goal is to work in public. I was inspired to start this
repository after reading Simon Wilson's [hacker new post][1], and he was
apparently inspired by Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection][2].


_6 TILs and counting..._
