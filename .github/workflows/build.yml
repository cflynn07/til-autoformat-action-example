          ### Example Repo  
            
          This is an example repository that uses my GitHub Action
          [cflynn07/github-action-til-autoformat-readme][3]. This GitHub Action
          automatically generated this README.md based on the TILs in this repository.

          A collection of concrete writeups of small things I learn daily while working
          and researching. My goal is to work in public. I was inspired to start this
          repository after reading Simon Wilson's [Hacker News post][1], and he was
          apparently inspired by Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection][2].
